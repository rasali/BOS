	<p>Welcome to the Primary School at Baku Oxford School. Our Primary School extends from Grade 1 to Grade 5. Grades are comprised of three classes with no more than 20 students in each class. Our students enjoy learning in spacious classrooms, well equipped art studios, a computer room, a purpose built theatre and the Primary School library. All classrooms have interactive whiteboards. Opened in June 2017, students benefit from and a brand new, state of the art gymnasium, dance rooms and swimming pool. At BOS we are committed to our mission of ensuring students’ unique qualities are valued and learner needs supported. Our teachers differentiate activities to engage each individual student and to extend their learning through appropriate, motivational challenges.</p>

	<p><strong>Grades 1 and 2</strong></p>

	<p>To ensure a smooth transition from Foundation Stage, learning in Grades 1 and 2 is engaged through a series of Humanities topics which complement the Cambridge Primary Curriculum for English, Maths and Science. Humanities combines History, Geography, Internationalism and Society elements, encouraging students to make connections between subjects and their real lives. ICT is integrated throughout all of the curriculum areas to enhance the key skills of communication, creativity, collaboration and critical thinking.</p>

	<p>Grades 1 and 2 students have their own classroom and class teacher for the majority of lessons. The class teacher develops a strong relationship with students and their families and is in the main point of contact for home school communications. Class teachers ensure that every child is safe and happy in school by closely monitoring student wellbeing, nurturing independence and providing emotional guidance and support. Class teachers also teach their class the following academic subjects:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Music</li>
		<li>Physical Education (including Dance)</li>
		<li>Art</li>
		<li>The home languages of Azeri and Russian or English enrichment</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Grades 3 to 5</strong></p>

	<p>Grades 3 to 5 take the same subjects as Grades 1 and 2 (see above) but these are entirely taught by specialist subject teachers in order to recognise the students’ increasing independence and higher levels of learning. However, as primary age children who need pastoral support, Grades 3, 4 and 5 students benefit from having a homeroom teacher responsible for registration, home/school communication and the general happiness and welfare of every child. The Cambridge Primary Curriculum for English, Maths and Science is continued through Grades 3, 4 and 5.</p>

	<p><strong>Guided Reading</strong></p>

Our students become life-long readers for pleasure and purpose.</p>

	<p><strong>Promoting Positive Behaviour and School Values</strong></p>

	<p>At Baku Oxford School, we aim to nurture productive, caring students with sound moral values and empowering personal qualities. Primary students join together each week as a whole Primary School assembly to celebrate achievement, share learning and find out what has been going on in school and across the world. Assembly is a time when school values are promoted and explained in a child friendly way to foster the positive attitudes and behaviours that we embrace at Baku Oxford School. The highlight of assembly is the awarding of Star of the Week Certificates, where students are acknowledged for something special that they have achieved or demonstrated. On a daily basis, positive behaviour is recognised through feedback and rewards that are explicitly linked to our school values and vision in child friendly language. It is important that students understand why values are important and can give practical examples of values in action.</p>

We are very receptive to requests to tour our school facilities and to sample the special learning environment here in Primary. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
