<p><strong>&nbsp;Thank you for visiting our website!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; Baku-Oxford School is a leading international co-educational day school founded in 1998. We run the Cambridge &nbsp; &nbsp; International Programmes throughout the school, leading to &nbsp; &nbsp; A/S and A levels on graduation. Currently, we deliver our programmes to a variety of nationalities, including students from 30 countries around the world.</p>

<p>Baku-Oxford School is a learning orientated establishment dedicated to providing a top quality international education for the local and expatriate communities of Baku. Students at the school can expect to learn in small classes of no more than 20, allowing the teacher to focus on individual needs and give attention to learner differences. Our faculty and student population reflect the increasingly cosmopolitan nature of Baku and we recruit the best local teachers as well as the best international teaching staff to provide a diverse and cross cultural approach to education, while recognizing our place in Baku and Azerbaijan as the host country. While English is the language of instruction, we also understand the importance of developing mother tongue languages and support both Azeri and Russian as a first language. Other support services we offer are an EAL programme for second language students, and SEN support for students with minor learning difficulties.</p>

<p>We strongly believe in a holistic approach to education and offer a wide range of after school activities including Dance, Drama and Art, as well as the more traditional sporting pursuits such as football, basketball and badminton etc. We regularly participate in tournaments within Azerbaijan and in the region, and students also represent the school in MUN conferences around the world.</p>

<p>Our new campus was opened by President Aliyev in November 2014 and combines a traditional look with state of the art teaching facilities. Please take the time to browse through our website to get an overall picture of the school and the curriculum we offer.</p>

<p>We welcome visitors and guests, so look forward to meeting you in the near future.</p>
